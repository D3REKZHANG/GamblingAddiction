You are dealt two cards. These cards will be combined with table cards to form poker hands.\n\
There are 4 rounds: Pre-Flop, Flop, Turn, River. Each round reveals more table cards, up to a\n\
final table of 5 cards.\n\n\
**__Betting__**\n\
In the pre-flop (b4 any table cards have been revealed), everyone can raise or check.To bet\n\
*match will match the current minimum bet\n\
*raise will increase the min bet.\n\
*check will let you pass your turn, not betting.\n\
*You must always match the current bet, raise (if it's your turn) or fold*\n\
*This means you cannot check if there is an active bet*\n\n\
You can also choose to fold, meaning you withdraw from the game to save yourself from losing more money.\n\
The round will proceed once everyone has matched the last bet or folded\n\n\
Note that if everyone checks, the round will also proceed\n\
**This all may sound confusing, but there will always be someone to explain it to you in game!**\n\n\
